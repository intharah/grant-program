### Overview

<br />

Digital Village (DV) is a recomposition of social media, gaming and e-commerce. DV is the first real-time Sustainable Multiplayer Metaverse connected to its Social Marketplace, which merges the physical and digital world with its own social blockchain interface, Village Protocol, and allows the real utility of digital assets in a metaverse going beyond scarcity and reputation. Digital Village metaverse will create hundreds of use cases for NFTs and enable users to import and actually use them within games, events and experiences in DV metaverse. DV applies human-centric design principles to create a Metaverse through the blockchain-based Metaprofiles powered by The Village Protocol Social System, connecting users through the marketplace to the DV MMO, connecting users with physical environments through their digital footprints.

### Ecosystem Fit
* Our platform can help the VeChain ecosystem to launch their eNFTs, find utility for their assets in our metaverse, connect physical NFTs to digital NFTs, engage with the new generation and learn how their  customers are interacting with their digital products and services to develop sustainable physical supply chain  which can resonate with their customers. 
 
* Digital Village merges digital world with real world by tracing digital footprints of the users and goods. Digital Village is currently in discussions with departments of sustainable development in several cities to take up residence and use Digital Village to simulate human behavior for social betterment, tackle climate change, and build better societies. 
 
* Businesses developing on VeChain can add new revenue channels and  explore new business models 

* Traditional companies can adapt Digital Village to gamify and better communicate their supply chain better to their customers by connecting it to Village Protocol
